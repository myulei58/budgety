# Budgety - Monthly Budgeting App

Budgety is a simple budgeting application for the current month. Users can add income or expense transactions, which the app will display in an organized table. It will then calculate the total budget available for the month, as well as the percentage of the income for each expense item. 

This web app is the second project from *The Complete JavaScript Course* by Jonas Schmedtmann. It uses more advanced ES5 structures and a module pattern design approach.
